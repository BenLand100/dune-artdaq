Some explanation about the calculation of pedestals and noise in the 35t.
The module was wrtitten by Gabriel Santucci, based on the 
Online Monitor module written by Mike Walbank.


issue0 = no data in the channel.
issue1 = all ADCs in the channel are stuck (ADC & 0x3F == 0 or 63).
issue2 = stuck ADCs make the simple mean and/or rms differ.
issue3 = channel has data, but few statistics (less than 1 window worth of data).
issue4 = should be equal to issue3.
issue5 = same as issue4 but for RMS windows instead of Mean windows.
issue6 = signal algorithm and simple mean/rms do not agree (meandiff > 10 and/or rmsdiff > 5).
issue7 = rms = 0.
issue8 = rms > 20.
issue9 = mean > 1000.
issue10 = mean < 200.
issue11 = rms < 2.
